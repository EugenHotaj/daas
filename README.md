# üèñ Automate boring decisions with ML

Decisions as a Service (DaaS) is an efficent AutoML system built on top of [Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray).

Example:
```python3

def automate_boring_decision(model_id, features):
  response = request.post(
      url="<server-address>/models/predict", 
      json={"model_id": model_id, "features": features}
  )
  if response["probs"]["do_the_one_thing"] >= 0.5:
      label = do_the_one_thing()
  else:
      label = do_the_other_thing()
  requests.post(
      url="<server-address>/models/train", 
      json={"prediction_id": response["prediction_id"], "label": label
  )
```
